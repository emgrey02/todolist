# To-do List from The Odin Project
- a to-do list made with vanilla javascript, scss, and html
- each task can have a title, description, due date, and priority level
- store your tasks in separate 'Lists' or 'Projects'
- view all your tasks on one page regardless of what project it's apart of
- view all tasks due today
- view all tasks that are upcoming
- your data is stored in local storage so it doesn't disappear on reload
- used factory functions and IIFEs to organize javascript
